## Repository Structure

Each day will have its own directory following the naming scheme `day-xx`. For example, the first day will have a folder called `day-01` and the twelfth day will have a folder called `day-12`

Since each day has 2 parts, the folder for each day will contain two other folders titled `part-1` and `part-2`. Put your respective solutions in each folder.

Name your solution files following the scheme `<Your Name>.<extension>` (e.g. `Thomas.cpp` or `Shubh.py`)

## Adding your solutions

You should create a fork of this repository and write your solutions there. To edit your forked version, either use Git to locally clone it to your computer or create a GitHub Codespace.

Once you have written and verified your solutions, open a pull request to merge changes from your fork to the main repository.
